# Big-Data_and-Cloud--Practical-development-and-NoSQL_DE24
This repo is part of my coursework in Big Data and Cloud Solutions. The course focuses on giving me both knowledge and practical skills in working with big data and cloud platforms such as Amazon, Google, and Microsoft.

Throughout the course I’m learning about:

Big data architecture and its different layers

How to work with data models, storage and implementations

Big data analytics in practice

NoSQL databases and how to apply them

This repository includes assignments, examples and projects I’ve worked on during the course.
